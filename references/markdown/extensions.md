Bluefin uses the [Extension Manager](https://flathub.org/apps/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager) by Matthew Jakeman to manage the desktop extensions. The application is included by default. You can access it via the [Logo Menu](https://github.com/Aryan20/Logomenu) (thanks Aryan Kaushik!)

Some of you might want a more upstream GNOME experience: you can turn off the AppIndicator extension and the Dash to Dock extension. This will give you a more upstream GNOME experience.

And if you want to hide the gsconnect and/or tailscale extensions you can toggle them on/off as well.
